## Dataset
- Over 1000 records from Melbourne water database and Melbourne airport weather station (from 01/01/2014 to 31/12/2019)
- Several records with Null values, very low power consumption (near zero), extremely high consumptions, irrelevant feature
values, and outlier data values (data point that differs significantly
from other observations) were removed.
